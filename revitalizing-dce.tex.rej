 Initially we looked for simpler solutions to disable security checks through compilation flags but none were found. We also reached out to glibc maintainers for 
 suggestions on alternatives or introduce patches to match our needs, but made no progress, so we decided to make a custom glibc based native build which came with some

+installation cost as the build required increased disk space. This motivated us to also pursue a Docker alternative with a simpler setup and similar disk usage as older releases.
 
 \subsubsection{Custom glibc-2.31-based build}
 The section discusses how the modified glibc is patched to disable problematic security checks discussed above in Section 2.1, and also
